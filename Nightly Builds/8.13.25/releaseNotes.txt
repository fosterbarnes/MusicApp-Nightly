8.12.25 Release Notes
Fixes:
- Implemented a workaround to get the default animations for minimizing and restoring a window from a minimized state with the custom title bar. By default, no animation is shown with custom WPF title bars.
	- Implemented the same workaround to get the window closing animation
- Playing a song after reaching the end of the queue with shuffle on no longer results in a crash
- Shuffle now works properly. Intended shuffle behaviour:
	- When a song is selected in the library while shuffle is activated, a new randomized queue is created starting with the selected song, and contains the entire music library in a randomized order.
	- When shuffle is activated while a song is already playing, the same behaviour above applies to this action
	- When selecting a song in queue view while shuffle is activated, we just skip to this song in the randomized queue without resetting it or creating a new one

Additions:
- Animations for queue, shuffle and repeat buttons. Added a function for this animation so it can be re-used
- Added queue button below "Music Library". This brings you to the "queue view"
	- Queue view shows the current song queue (who could have guessed omg that's so surprising)
	- The queue view dynamically updates as the queue progresses, works whether or not shuffle is activated
- Added queue button to title bar. This is a placeholder and doesn't do anything yet. This will show the same list as the queue view, but in a narrower, smaller pop out window for easy access

Code Changes/Refactoring:
- Much more robust error handling for playback and related functions
	
What's broken:
- Repeat button does nothing
- Queue button in title bar does nothing
