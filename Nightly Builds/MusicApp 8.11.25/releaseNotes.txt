8.11.25 Release Notes
Fixes:
- Fix issue where clicking and dragging on the seek bar and holding a time would result in the song "skipping" forward beyond the selected time. The track is still being played in the background muted, so when the user held on a position, the song would start playing a few seconds past where the user wanted.
- Current time on seek bar is smoothly updated when the window size changes. Previously it would "jump" to the current position a moment after the window size changed.
- Adjusted spacing of the currently playing section and element within.

Additions:
- Added shuffle and repeat buttons. Repeat button has 2 different "on" states, repeat all and repeat one. 
	- Shuffle button works with some errors
	- Repeat button does not work. Button styling is defined but there is no repeat logic for playback
	
What's broken:
- Playing a song after reaching the end of the queue with shuffle on results in a crash
